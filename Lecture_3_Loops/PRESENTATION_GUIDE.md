## Study Tips

### For Loop Mastery
1. Practice with different types of sequences (lists, strings, ranges)
2. Understand the loop variable and how it changes each iteration
3. Start with simple examples, then add complexity
4. Visualize what happens in each iteration

### While Loop Mastery
1. Always ensure your condition will eventually become false
2. Be very careful with infinite loops
3. Use counters or state changes to control iteration
4. Test edge cases (empty conditions, immediate false, etc.)

### range() Function
1. Memorize the three forms: range(stop), range(start, stop), range(start, stop, step)
2. Remember that stop is exclusive (not included)
3. Practice counting backwards with negative steps
4. Use range when you need to repeat a specific number of times

### Break and Continue
1. Use break when you've found what you need - don't waste time
2. Use continue to skip processing unwanted items
3. These make your code more efficient
4. Always consider: could this be done with a better condition instead?

### For Automation Context
1. Think: "Where would I need to process multiple elements?"
2. Consider data-driven testing scenarios
3. Think about error handling with retries
4. Practice converting manual test steps to loops

## Troubleshooting

### Presentation won't open
- Ensure you have a modern web browser installed
- Try a different browser
- Check that the file has a `.html` extension
- Make sure the file isn't corrupted

### Navigation not working
- Try using keyboard arrows instead of buttons
- Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Styles look broken
- Verify the `assets` folder exists in the parent directory
- Check that `assets/presentation/css/styles.css` exists
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Try a different browser

### Code examples hard to read
- Use browser zoom: Ctrl + (plus) to zoom in
- Or use Ctrl + Mouse Wheel to adjust zoom
- Try full-screen mode (F11) for better view
- Adjust your monitor's resolution if needed

### Understanding Infinite Loops
- If a code example seems stuck, that's intentional for demonstration
- The presentation will explain how to avoid infinite loops
- Never run infinite loop examples without an exit strategy
- Learn to recognize the warning signs

## Customization

### To modify the presentation content:
1. Open `presentation.html` in a text editor
2. Find the slide you want to edit (search for slide content)
3. Modify content between `<div class="slide">` tags
4. Save and refresh your browser

### To change global styling:
1. Edit `assets/presentation/css/styles.css`
2. Changes apply to all lecture presentations
3. See `assets/presentation/README.md` for details

- **examples/** - Runnable Python code demonstrating each concept
- **exercises/** - Practice problems to test your understanding
- **SOLUTIONS.md** - Complete solutions for all exercises

## Quick Reference

### For Loop Syntax
```python
for item in sequence:
    # code to repeat
```

### While Loop Syntax
```python
while condition:
    # code to repeat
    # (must change condition eventually!)
```

### range() Patterns
```python
range(5)           # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
range(2, 6)        # 2, 3, 4, 5
range(0, 10, 2)    # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8
range(10, 0, -1)   # 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

### Control Statements
```python
break     # Exit loop immediately
continue  # Skip to next iteration
```

### Common Loop Patterns
```python
# Iterate with index
for i in range(len(items)):
    print(f"Item {i}: {items[i]}")

# Enumerate for index and item
for i, item in enumerate(items):
    print(f"Item {i}: {item}")

# While with counter
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```
