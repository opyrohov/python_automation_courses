## Practical Applications

As you go through the presentation, you'll learn how these concepts directly apply to automation:

**String Manipulation Use Cases:**
- Extracting data from web pages
- Validating form inputs
- Parsing URLs and API responses
- Cleaning and formatting text data

**Control Flow Use Cases:**
- Making decisions based on page state
- Handling different test scenarios
- Implementing error recovery logic
- Creating dynamic test flows

## Browser Compatibility

This presentation works on all modern browsers:
- ✅ Google Chrome (recommended)
- ✅ Mozilla Firefox
- ✅ Microsoft Edge
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Opera

**Note:** No internet connection required! The presentation is completely self-contained.

## File Structure

The presentation uses **global shared assets** for consistency:

## Study Tips

### For String Manipulation
1. Practice typing string methods without looking them up
2. Create your own examples using real text from websites
3. Focus on f-strings as the modern formatting approach
4. Memorize common patterns: `.strip()`, `.split()`, `.replace()`

### For Control Flow
1. Draw flowcharts for complex conditional logic
2. Test edge cases (empty values, None, etc.)
3. Practice writing conditions before looking at solutions
4. Think about real automation scenarios while learning

### For Automation Context
1. Always think: "How would I use this in a test?"
2. Look for patterns in the Playwright examples
3. Consider error scenarios and edge cases
4. Practice writing validation logic

## Troubleshooting

### Presentation won't open
- Ensure you have a modern web browser installed
- Try a different browser
- Check that the file has a `.html` extension
- Make sure the file isn't corrupted

### Navigation not working
- Try using keyboard arrows instead of buttons
- Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

### Styles look broken
- Verify the `assets` folder exists in the parent directory
- Check that `assets/presentation/css/styles.css` exists
- Clear browser cache and refresh
- Try a different browser

### Code examples hard to read
- Use browser zoom: Ctrl + (plus) to zoom in
- Or use Ctrl + Mouse Wheel to adjust zoom
- Try full-screen mode (F11) for better view
- Adjust your monitor's resolution if needed
